Task 1 – Day 3: Manual Testing – SQL Injection, XSS, and Authentication Flaws

Objective:
Manually exploit vulnerable parts of DVWA to demonstrate understanding of common OWASP Top 10 web vulnerabilities.

Tools Used:
- Firefox
- DVWA (localhost)
- Kali Terminal (for screenshots and setup)

1️⃣ SQL Injection
- Payload: 1' OR '1'='1
- Result: User details shown without proper authentication
- Screenshot: task1_day3_sql_injection.png

2️⃣ XSS (Reflected)
- Payload: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
- Result: JavaScript popup executed in browser
- Screenshot: task1_day3_xss_popup.png

3️⃣ Authentication Bypass
- Username: admin' OR '1'='1
- Password: 1234
- Result: Login bypassed using SQL logic flaw

Notes:
- All tests were conducted with DVWA security level set to 'Low'
- No external tools were needed — everything done inside Kali
- These vulnerabilities represent real threats in poorly coded apps
